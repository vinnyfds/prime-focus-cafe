# Immediate Rollback from Production Artifact

## Situation
The current source code contains only placeholder content, but we have a working production build artifact at `releases/prod-20241219/dist.zip` that contains the real website.

## Recovery Strategy
**Immediate Action**: Deploy the production artifact to restore the working website
**Long-term**: Investigate source code recovery from git history or backups

## Step-by-Step Rollback Commands

### 1. Extract the Production Artifact
```bash
# Navigate to releases directory
cd releases/prod-20241219

# Extract the production build
unzip dist.zip -d ../../dist-restored

# Verify the extracted content
ls -la ../../dist-restored/
```

### 2. Deploy the Restored Build to S3
```bash
# Upload the restored index.html with correct MIME type
aws s3 cp dist-restored/index.html s3://www.primefocususa.com-site/ \
  --content-type "text/html; charset=utf-8" \
  --cache-control "no-store"

# Upload the restored JavaScript bundle
aws s3 cp dist-restored/assets/*.js s3://www.primefocususa.com-site/assets/ \
  --content-type "application/javascript; charset=utf-8" \
  --cache-control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

# Upload the restored CSS bundle
aws s3 cp dist-restored/assets/*.css s3://www.primefocususa.com-site/assets/ \
  --content-type "text/css; charset=utf-8" \
  --cache-control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

# Upload any other assets
aws s3 cp dist-restored/assets/* s3://www.primefocususa.com-site/assets/ \
  --exclude "*.js" \
  --exclude "*.css"
```

### 3. Invalidate CloudFront Cache
```bash
# Create invalidation to serve the restored content
aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
  --distribution-id E32K05VBG79GEL \
  --paths "/*"
```

### 4. Verify the Rollback
```bash
# Test the website
curl -I "https://www.primefocususa.com"

# Check specific assets
curl -I "https://www.primefocususa.com/assets/index-*.js"
curl -I "https://www.primefocususa.com/assets/index-*.css"
```

## Expected Results
After rollback:
- ✅ Website displays full content (not just header)
- ✅ All sections load: Hero, Features, Ingredients, Testimonials, FAQ, References
- ✅ CSS and JavaScript load with correct MIME types
- ✅ No more "TypeError: n.map is not a function" errors

## Rollback Verification Checklist
- [ ] Website loads without crashes
- [ ] All sections display correctly
- [ ] CSS styling is applied
- [ ] JavaScript functionality works
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Assets return correct MIME types

## If Rollback Fails
1. **Check S3 uploads**: Verify files were uploaded correctly
2. **Check CloudFront**: Ensure invalidation completed
3. **Check MIME types**: Verify Content-Type headers are correct
4. **Fallback**: Use S3 versioning to restore previous working version

## Next Steps After Successful Rollback
1. **Document the success** in APP_LOG.md
2. **Investigate source code loss** - check git history, reflog, and backups
3. **Plan source code recovery** from git commits or external backups
4. **Implement source code backup** to prevent future loss

## Important Notes
- This rollback restores the **working website** but not the **source code**
- The source code recovery will require additional investigation
- The website will be functional but future development will be limited until source is recovered
